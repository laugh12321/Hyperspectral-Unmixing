    Function for running experiments on unmixing given a set of hyper parameters.

    :param data_file_path: Path to the data file. Supported types are: .npy.
    :param ground_truth_path: Path to the ground-truth data file.
    :param train_size: If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0.
        If int, specifies the number of samples in the training set.
        Defaults to 0.8
    :type train_size: Union[int, float]
    :param val_size: Should be between 0.0 and 1.0. Represents the
        percentage of samples from the training set to be
        extracted as a validation set.
        Defaults to 0.1.
    :param sub_test_size: Number of pixels to subsample the test set
        instead of performing the inference on all
        samples that are not in the training set.
    :param channels_idx: Index specifying the channels position in the provided data.
    :param neighborhood_size: Size of the spatial patch.
    :param n_runs: Number of total experiment runs.
    :param model_name: Name of the model, it serves as a key in the
        dictionary holding all functions returning models.
    :param dest_path: Path to where all experiment runs will be saved as
        subdirectories in this directory.
    :param sample_size: Size of the input sample.
    :param n_classes: Number of classes.
    :param lr: Learning rate for the model, i.e., regulates
        the size of the step in the gradient descent process.
    :param batch_size: Size of the batch used in training phase,
        it is the size of samples per gradient step.
    :param epochs: Number of epochs for model to train.
    :param verbose: Verbosity mode used in training, (0, 1 or 2).
    :param shuffle: Boolean indicating whether to shuffle datasets.
    :param patience: Number of epochs without improvement in order to
        stop the training phase.
    :param endmembers_path: Path to the endmembers matrix file,
        containing the average reflectances for each endmember,
        i.e., the pure spectra.
